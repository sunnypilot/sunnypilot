# Model Selector Version Compatibility

This document explains the version compatibility mechanism used by the Model Selector system, and the rationale behind certain version constraints and JSON file management strategies.

## Overview

The Model Selector is responsible for selecting and validating model bundles based on their metadata and version constraints. Each model bundle is distributed via a JSON file and includes a `minimumSelectorVersion` field indicating the minimum selector version required to load it.

To ensure robust compatibility and prevent mismatches between model expectations and selector capabilities, the selector enforces two version boundaries:

* **`REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION`**: the oldest selector version we support.
* **`CURRENT_SELECTOR_VERSION`**: the current version of the selector logic.

## Version Compatibility Check

A model bundle is considered compatible if:

```python
REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION <= bundle["minimumSelectorVersion"] <= CURRENT_SELECTOR_VERSION
```

This ensures:

* **Old bundles are rejected** if they rely on deprecated selector behavior.
* **Future bundles are ignored** if they expect logic that the current selector doesn't yet implement.

## Handling Breaking Changes

When a deep change in selector behavior requires *all* models to be recompiled (e.g., due to a major architectural update), we:

1. **Create a new JSON file** (e.g., from `models_v4.json` to `models_v5.json`).
2. **Assign updated `minimumSelectorVersion` values** in the new bundles.

This allows older selector versions to continue using the previous JSON file, while newer versions point to the new one, preventing cross-contamination.

## Why `REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION` Still Matters

Despite using new JSON files to isolate breaking changes, `REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION` plays a critical role:

### 1. **Cached Bundle Validation**

Model bundles are cached locally (e.g., in-memory or on disk). A user might have previously loaded a now-invalid bundle from an older JSON file.

`REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION` prevents the selector from reloading or trusting that stale cached bundle, even if the original JSON is gone.

### 2. **Explicit Deprecation Boundary**

By raising `REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION`, we declare older bundles officially unsupported, even if they technically still exist in a legacy JSON file.

### 3. **Avoiding Race Conditions**

Some clients may have intermittent access to updated JSONs. The runtime check ensures version compatibility is enforced independently of external file state.

## Summary

| Component                       | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `minimumSelectorVersion`        | Declares the minimum selector version required to load a model bundle |
| `REQUIRED_MIN_SELECTOR_VERSION` | Prevents loading bundles that are too old (e.g., from stale cache)    |
| `CURRENT_SELECTOR_VERSION`      | Prevents loading bundles that are too new or forward-incompatible     |
| JSON file renaming              | Isolates bundles by selector generation to handle full recompiles     |

This layered strategy ensures safe evolution of the model selection system while maintaining backward compatibility and runtime protection against stale or incompatible bundles.
