# Modular Assistive Driving System (M.A.D.S.)

Modular Assistive Driving System (MADS) aims to elevate the user's driving experience by modifying the behaviors of 
driving assist engagements.

!!! note
    This feature aligns closely with comma.ai's safety rules.

## Independent Engagement

MADS allows users to engage sunnypilot Automatic Lane Centering (ALC) for lateral control and Adaptive Cruise Control 
(ACC) or Smart Cruise Control (SCC) for longitudinal control independently.

!!! note "Why This Feature Exists"
    While newer car models allow for independent engagement of lateral (steering) and longitudinal (speed) control, 
    many older vehicle models and stock openpilot enforce engaging both controls together. MADS introduces this modern 
    convenience to older vehicle models, effectively backporting a feature found in newer cars and providing users more flexibility.
