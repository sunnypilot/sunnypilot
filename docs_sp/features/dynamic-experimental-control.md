# Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC)

Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC) intelligently switches between the standard adaptive cruise control (ACC) and the end-to-end longitudinal control of Experimental Mode based on the driving conditions.

**Chill Mode** is the standard adaptive cruise control method. It is designed to provide a smooth, predictable driving experience. However, it does not provide advanced driving capabilities like stopping at red lights and stop signs.

**Experimental Mode** allows the system to control the vehicle's speed and tries to drive like a human, enabling it to slow down for turns, stop at red lights, and stop signs. While capable and experimental, this mode can sometimes be overly cautious, especially on highways.

***Dynamic Experimental Control*** aims to provide the best of both worlds: the advanced capabilities of Experimental Mode when needed, and the smooth, predictable behavior of the standard system for less complex driving scenarios. This allows for a more natural driving experience by using Experimental Mode in situations where it excels, such as city driving and tight turns, while reverting to the default behavior for highway driving.
