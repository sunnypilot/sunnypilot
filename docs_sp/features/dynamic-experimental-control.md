# Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC)

Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC) intelligently switches between the standard adaptive cruise control and the end-to-end longitudinal control of Experimental Mode based on the driving conditions.

**Chill Mode** is the standard adaptive cruise control method. It is designed to provide a smooth, predictable driving experience. However, it does not provide advanced driving capabilities like stopping at red lights and stop signs.

**Experimental Mode** allows the system to control the vehicle's speed, enabling it to slow down for turns, stop at red lights, and stop signs. While powerful, this mode can sometimes be overly cautious, especially on highways.

***DEC*** aims to provide the best of both worlds: the advanced capabilities of Experimental Mode when needed, and the smooth, predictable behavior of the standard system for less complex driving scenarios. This allows for a more natural driving experience by using Experimental Mode in situations where it excels, such as city driving and tight turns, while reverting to the default behavior for highway driving.
