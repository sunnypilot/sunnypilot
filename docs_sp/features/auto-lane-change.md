# Auto Lane Change

sunnypilot's Auto Lane Change feature allows the vehicle to automatically change lanes.

## Key Setting and How to Use

- **Nudge to Confirm:** This is the default method. To perform a lane change, activate the turn signal in the desired direction and then gently turn the steering wheel (nudges) in the same direction to confirm the maneuver.
- **Nudge-less Lane Change:** For a more automated experience, users can enable a "nudge-less" option. With this setting, you only need to activate the turn signal to initiate a lane-change.
- **Nudge-less with Delay** This is same as Nudge-less mode, but with a fixed delay. Once the turn-indicator is activated, sunnypilot will wait for the selected delay before initiating the lane change.

### Additional Related Settings
- **Delay with Blind Spot:** This crucial safety feature adds a delay to the lane change if the vehicle's blind spot monitoring (BSM) system detects an object. The lane change will only proceed after the blind spot is clear.

## Important Considerations

- **Manual Override:** The driver can regain control at any time by taking control of the steering wheel.
- **Driver Monitoring:** sunnypilot utilizes driver monitoring to ensure the driver remains attentive.
- **Object Detection:** The system is primarily designed to follow lane lines and may not detect all objects. The driver must always be prepared to take control.
- **Lane Markings:** The feature's performance is dependent on clear and visible lane markings.
