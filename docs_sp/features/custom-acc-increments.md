# Custom ACC Increments

sunnypilot offers customization to the set speed increments for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) when sunnypilot is controlling the vehicle's longitudinal control. This allows for more precise speed adjustments compared to the default behavior of many vehicles.

- **Short press**: This controls the speed adjustment when the "RES+" or "SET-" button is pressed for a short period of time.
  - Allowed values: 1 through 10
- **Long press**: This controls the speed adjustment when the "RES+" or "SET-" button is pressed for a longer duration.
  - Allowed values: 1, 5, 10
