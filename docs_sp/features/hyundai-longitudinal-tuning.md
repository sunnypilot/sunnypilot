# **How custom longitudinal tuning works for Hyundai/Kia/Genesis vehicles in sunnypilot.**

To begin this documentation, I would like to first present the safety guidelines followed to create the tune:

Our main safety guideline considered is [ISO 15622:2018](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso:15622:ed-3:v1:en)
This provides the groundwork of safety limits this tune must adhere too, and therefore, must be followed.
For example, in our jerk calculations throughout this tune, you will see how maximum jerk is clipped using the equation provided.

In the tuning you will see a set of equations, the first being jerk, **but what exactly is jerk?**
Jerk is calculated by taking current acceleration (in the form of m/s^2), subtracting that by previous acceleration, and
dividing that by time. In our tune you will see the following equation:

    planned_accel = CC.actuators.accel
    current_accel = CS.out.aEgo
    blended_value = 0.67 * planned_accel + 0.33 * current_accel
    delta = blended_value - self.state.accel_last_jerk

    self.state.jerk = math.copysign(delta * delta, delta)
    self.state.accel_last_jerk = blended_value

Instead of using a hardcoded time, we are focused on making jerk parabolic. First we have our planned acceleration from longitudinal_planner.
Then we have our current carstate acceleration. These are then blended together 67:33 = 100% to form our blended value.
Following this, we have our delta which subtracts our blended_value from our previous acceleration `self.state.accel_last_jerk`
Lastly, we have our finalized jerk calculation, which squares the delta to create a parabolic response while retaining the original sign,
which could be positive or negative (e.g., 5.0 or -5.0). This then goes through our minimum and maximum clipping
which forces a value between our set min and max, which I discuss later in this readme.

Moving on, the accel_last_jerk, stores current accel after each iteration and uses that in the calculation as previous accel for
our jerk calculations. Now we see the calculation of jerk max and jerk min. 

### Let's dive into how jerk lower limit max is calculated:

     velocity = CS.out.vEgo
    if velocity < 5.0:
      decel_jerk_max = self.car_config.jerk_limits[1]
    elif velocity > 20.0:
      decel_jerk_max = 2.5
    else:
      decel_jerk_max = 3.64284 - 0.05714 * velocity

This equation above is set by ISO 15622, and dictates that jerk lower limit can only be five when below 5 m/s. In our equation,

    self.car_config.jerk_limits[1] 

Jerk_limits[1] represents a jerk value of 3.3 m/s^3, which is the maximum analyzed lower jerk rate seen on stock SCC CAN.
Between 5 m/s and 20 m/s jerk is capped using the calculation:

    decel_jerk_max = 3.64284 - 0.05714 * velocity

This equation calculates the linear jerk from 6m/s to 19m/s, scaling down from 3.3 to 2.5 m/s^3.
This means that if current velocity is say, 15 m/s the final jerk max value would be capped at 2.78 m/s^3.
Anything above 20 m/s is capped to a lower jerk max of 2.5 m/s^3. This allows for a smoother jerk range, while complying to ISO standards to a tee.
The current jerk Lower Limit you will see in openpilot before this tune, is 5.0 m/s^3; Which as you can see from using the above calculation,
the 5.0 m/s^3 technically does not comply with ISO standards at any speed above 5.0 m/s^3.
Having our jerk max be clipped to these values not only allows for better consistency with ISO standards, 
but also enables us to have a much smoother braking experience.

### Getting into our next topic, I would like to explain how our minimum jerk was chosen.

Minimum jerk was chosen based off of the following guideline proposed by Handbook of Intellegent Vehicles (2012):
`Ride comfort may be sacrificed only under emergency conditions when vehicle and occupant safety consideration may preclude comfort.`

### What the value of 0.53 m/s^3 of the jerk lower limit was chosen based off of

[Carlowitz et al. (2024).](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382274551_User_evaluation_of_comfortable_deceleration_profiles_for_highly_automated_driving_Findings_from_a_test_track_study)
This research study identified the average lower jerk used in comfortable driving settings, which is 0.53 m/s^3.
This is then inputted to jerk_limits[0] as 0.53 m/s^3 represents the value used in upper jerk absolute minimum.

     min_lower_jerk = self.car_config.jerk_limits[0]

As shown above, lower jerk minimum of 0.53 is used for our lower_jerk minimum bounds.

### Why our minimum upper jerk is conditional

Our minimum upper band jerk is conditional as well and is denoted below:

    min_upper_jerk = self.car_config.jerk_limits[0] if (velocity > 3.611) else 0.60

This means that for speeds under 3.611 m/s (8.077 mph/ 13 kph) we have a minimum jerk of 0.60. This allows for smooth
takeoffs while not causing lag. For all other speeds, we use our normal jerk_limit for minimum, which is 0.53.

### Next, we have our acceleration limiting

For acceleration limiting, we use TCS signal brakeLightsDEPRECATED to measure when to enact the standstill delay 
which stock SCC uses to allow smoother transitions in acceleration.

### Lastly, we have our accel value calculations for hyundaican.py

For our accel value calculations we have the following:

   `self.accel_value = np.clip(self.accel_raw, self.state.accel_last - jerk_number, self.state.accel_last + jerk_number)`

This essentially means that we have our accel_raw, which is acceleration (m/s^2), followed by our clipping variables. 
jerk_number in this equation represents exactly `0.1`, which is subtracted or added by self.state.accel_last, which is 
previous calculated accel_value. Furthermore, we have `self.state.accel_last`, which is calculated as the stored accel from
the above calculations.
