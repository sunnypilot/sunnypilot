# To start using sunnypilot in a car

To use sunnypilot in a car, you need four things:

1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).

2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `release-c3.sunnypilot.ai` to install the release version.

3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md).

4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

[comma.ai](https://comma.ai) have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup).

!!! note
    It's possible to run sunnypilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.
