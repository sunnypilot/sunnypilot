# How to contribute

Our software is open source so you can solve your own problems without needing help from others. And if you solve a problem and are so kind, you can upstream it for the rest of the world to use. Check out our [post about open-sourcing and externalization](https://www.sunnypilot.ai/blog/july/a-new-chapter-transparency/). Development activity is coordinated through our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/issues), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/discussions), and [Discord](https://discord.sunnypilot.ai).

### Getting Started

* Setup your [development environment](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/tree/master/tools)
* Read about the [development workflow](WORKFLOW.md)
* Join our [Discord](https://discord.sunnypilot.ai)
* Docs are at [https://docs.sunnypilot.ai](https://docs.sunnypilot.ai) and [https://www.sunnypilot.ai/blog](https://www.sunnypilot.ai/blog)

## What contributions are we looking for?

**sunnypilot's priorities are [safety](../SAFETY.md), stability, quality, and features, in that order.** Aligning with comma's ideals, part of sunnypilot's mission is to *solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries*, and **all** development is towards that goal.

### What gets merged?

The probability of a pull request being merged is a function of its value to the project and the effort it will take us to get it merged.
If a PR offers *some* value but will take lots of time to get merged, it will be closed.
Simple, well-tested bug fixes are the easiest to merge, and new features are the hardest to get merged. 

All of these are examples of good PRs:

* [typo fix](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/30678)
* [removing unused code](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/30573)
* [simple car model port](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/30245)
* [car brand port](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/23331)
* [UI design changes](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/commit/84f6fce90639135611ec568c4d39a352a300bede)
* [new features](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/commit/68e1379003bfdb599921cf9cd5684bfb762fd676)

### What doesn't get merged?

* **arbitrary style changes**: code is art, and it's up to the author to make it beautiful
* **500+ line PRs**: clean it up, break it up into smaller PRs, or both
* **PRs without a clear goal**: every PR must have a singular and clear goal

### First contribution

Check out any [good first issue from commaai's openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get started.

### What do I need to contribute?

A lot of sunnypilot work requires only a PC, and some requires a comma device.
Most car-related contributions require access to that car, plus a comma device installed in the car.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests should be against the [`master`](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot) branch. If you're unsure about a contribution, feel free to open a discussion, issue, or draft PR to discuss the problem you're trying to solve.

A good pull request has all of the following:

- a clearly stated purpose
- every line changed directly contributes to the stated purpose
- verification, i.e. how did you test your PR?
- justification

    * if you've optimized something, post benchmarks to prove it's better
    * if you've improved your car's tuning, post before and after plots

- passes the CI tests

## Contributing without Code

* Report bugs in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/sunnypilot/sunnypilot/issues).
* Report driving issues in the `#general` Discord channel.
* Consider opting into driver camera uploads to improve the driver monitoring model.
* Connect your device to Wi-Fi regularly, so that comma can pull data for training better driving models.
* Run the `staging-c3` branch and report issues. This branch is like `master` but it's built just like a release.
