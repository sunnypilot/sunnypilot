## What is LAICa?
LAICa is a fork of [sunnypilot](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot), an open source driver assistance system. SunnyPilot offers the user a unique driving experience for over 300+ supported car makes and models with modified behaviors of driving assist engagements

This particular fork is used in my 2021 Volkswagen GLI, attempting to add modifications and hacks to the SunnyPilot codebase for my personal use.

The catch is I'm trying to do this without doing heavy modifications to the codebase, only minor changes through clever tactics that mostly leverage Python's polymorphism to override original behavior.

## Installation
Run this in Comma 3X:

```bash
cd /data; rm  -rf ./openpilot; git clone -b master --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lesmo/laica.git openpilot; cd /data/openpilot; git lfs pull; sudo reboot
```

## ðŸŽ† Pull Requests
I welcome both pull requests and issues on GitHub.

Pull requests should be against the most current `master` branch.

## ðŸ“Š User Data

By default, sunnypilot uploads the driving data to comma servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai/).

sunnypilot is open source software. The user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

sunnypilot logs the road-facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver-facing camera and microphone are only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings.

By using this software, you understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.
